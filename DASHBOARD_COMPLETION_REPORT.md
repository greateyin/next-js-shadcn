## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded Dashboard Stats ✅

**Problem:**
- Stats cards showed static hardcoded values
- No connection to real database data
- "Add more dashboard content here" comment remained

**Solution:**
- Created `/api/dashboard/stats` endpoint
- Fetches real data: users, roles, applications, sessions, permissions
- Displays recent activities from audit logs
- Shows growth metrics and real-time updates

**Files Created:**
- `app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts`

**Files Modified:**
- `components/dashboard/dashboard-content.tsx` - Now client component with real data fetching

---

### 2. Dead Link to /dashboard/settings ✅

**Problem:**
- Menu seed data created /dashboard/settings link
- Page didn't exist, causing 404 errors
- Settings pointed to wrong location

**Solution:**
- Created `/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
- Created `DashboardSettingsContent` component
- Implemented 4 configuration tabs:
  - Notifications (email, system, digest)
  - Privacy (visibility, online status, mentions)
  - Display (theme, compact mode, sidebar)
  - Security (session timeout, password, 2FA)

**Files Created:**
- `app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
- `components/dashboard/dashboard-settings-content.tsx`

---

### 3. Non-functional Search Bar ✅

**Problem:**
- Search input had no event handling
- No data source or API
- Static UI only

**Solution:**
- Created `/api/dashboard/search` endpoint

- Real-time results with debouncing
- Dropdown display with navigation

**Features:**

- Loading state with spinner

**Files Created:**

---

### 4. Static Notification Bell ✅

**Problem:**

---

### 5. Missing Help Page ✅

**Problem:**

### 6. Uncontrolled Admin Panel Link ✅

**Problem:**

- No role-based access control

**Solution:**

**Files Modified:**
- `components/dashboard/dashboard-sidebar.tsx` - Added role-based rendering

---

### 7. Quick Actions Pointing to Wrong Location ✅

**Problem:**
- Quick Actions buttons linked to `/settings`
- Should link to dashboard-specific settings
- No dashboard settings page existed

**Solution:**
- Updated Quick Actions to point to `/dashboard/settings`

- `components/dashboard/profile-content.tsx` - Updated button links

---

### 8. Missing Notifications Management Page ✅
