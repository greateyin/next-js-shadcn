# **Next.js 15+ Micro-Frontend Dashboard Architecture Implementation Guide**  
**Dynamic Module Integration with Module Federation**

This guide provides a **detailed implementation plan** for building an **enterprise-level micro-frontend dashboard architecture** in **Next.js 15+**, using **Webpack Module Federation** for dynamic module integration. The document covers **architecture design, Module Federation technical implementation, CI/CD deployment, SSR/SSG strategies, security authentication, and performance monitoring**. It also includes best practices, code examples, Mermaid diagrams, and step-by-step implementation details.

## **1. Architecture Design and Pattern Selection**

### **Micro-Frontend Module Division**

The **Micro-Frontend** (MFE) architecture divides the front-end application into multiple **independent modules**, each responsible for a **specific business function**board scenario, we can divide it into multiple sub-applications based on function, such as:

- **Data Visualization Module**: Provides chart displays and real-time dashboards.
- **Operational Analysis Module**: Offers business insights such as funnel analysis and KPI tracking.
- **Report System Module**: Handles report generation, export, and viewing.

By **modularizing by business domain**, each team can independently develop and deploy their own modules without affecting others. This enhances **development autonomy and deployment flexibility** . However, must be **integrated into a unified shell application (Host App)** to ensure a consistent **user experience**. The shell application provides the **global page framework, navigation, and styling**, while also handling **cross-module shared functions** such as authentication, logging, and analytics .

When designing thesion, it's crucial to ensure that each **Micro-Frontend module remains self-contained**, covering a **complete business domain**. Internal components within a module can be further divided, but externally, they should expose a unified interface. For example, our architecture ensures that the **Data Visualization, Operational Analysis, and Report System** modules are **independent yet combinable**, allowing the shell application to integrate them into a complete dashboard.

### **Multi-Tenant Support (Multi-Tenancy)**

Enterprise **SaaS dashboards** often require **multi-tenant support**, meaning the same application instance serves multiple tenants (customers), **sharing code and infrastructure while keeping data and configurations isolated** . This guide implements a **singmulti-tenancy** model where all tenants use the same Next.js application, with **tenant identification for data isolation**.

Key aspects of implementing **multi-tenant isolation** include:

- **Tenant Identification Parsing**: Determine the current tenant using **request domains or URL paths**.  
  - Example: Use **subdomains** like `tenantA.example.com`, `tenantB.example.com` or **URL prefixes** like `/tenantA/*`, `/tenantB/*` to differentiate tenants.
  - In Next.js, we can use a **middleware (`middleware.ts`)** to extract the **tenant ID** from `request.headers.host` or URL path and store it in a **request context or cookie** for further processing.
  
- **Tenant-Specific Configurations**: Maintain **independent settings** (branding, feature toggles) for each tenant.  
  - These configurations can be stored in **JSON files** or a **database**, and dynamically loaded based on the tenant ID at runtime.

- **Data Isolation**: Ensure all database queries or API requests **filter by tenant ID** to prevent cross-tenant data leakage.  
  - For example, every query should include a **tenant-specific filter** (`WHERE tenant_id = X`).
  - A **middleware** can inject this filter automatically to **prevent unauthorized cross-tenant data access**.

- **Tenant-Level Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
  - Each tenant should define its **own roles and permission sets**.  
  - A user may have **different roles in different tenants** (e.g., Admin in Tenant A but Viewer in Tenant B).  
  - The system must support **multi-tenant multi-role assignments**.

To implement **Tenant-Level RBAC**, we include a **tenant-role mapping** in JWT authentication.  
Example JWT claims:  
```json
{
  "roles": {
    "tenantA": ["admin"],
    "tenantB": ["viewer"]
  }
}
```
This ensures that users only have access to the **relevant tenant's resources** based on their **assigned roles**.

## **2. Module Federation Technical Implementation**

### **Webpack Module Federation + SSR Support**

We use **Webpack 5 Module Federation** for **runtime loading of remote micro-frontend modules**, allowing each micro-frontend module to be **independently deployed and dynamically loaded** in the **host application** .

Since Next.js includes **Server-Side Ren**, we must ensure that **Module Federation works seamlessly in SSR environments**.

- **Default Module Federation behavior**: Modules are typically loaded **in the browser (CSR)**, where Webpack dynamically fetches remote module scripts.
- **For SSR support**:  
  - We need a mechanism to **pre-fetch remote modules** during server rendering.  
  - A common workaround is using **dynamic imports (`next/dynamic`)** with `ssr: false`, meaning remote components are **only loaded on the client**.

#### **Example: Dynamically Importing a Remote Module in Next.js**
```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

// Load the Reports Module dynamically (Client-Side Only)
const ReportApp = dynamic(() => import('reports/ReportApp'), { ssr: false });

export default function ReportsPage() {
  return <ReportApp />;
}
```
In this example:
- The `reports/ReportApp` component is dynamically loaded at runtime **only on the client**, avoiding SSR issues.
- During SSR, Next.js will render a **placeholder**, then fetch the remote module in the browser.

### **Host Application Webpack Configuration**
```js
// host-app next.config.js
const { NextFederationPlugin } = require('@module-federation/nextjs-mf');
module.exports = {
  webpack(config, options) {
    if (!options.isServer) {
      config.plugins.push(
        new NextFederationPlugin({
          name: 'hostApp',
          remotes: {
            dataVizApp: `dataVizApp@${process.env.DATAVIZ_URL}/_next/static/chunks/remoteEntry.js`,
            reportsApp: `reportsApp@${process.env.REPORTS_URL}/_next/static/chunks/remoteEntry.js`,
          },
          shared: {
            react: { singleton: true, eager: true },
            'react-dom': { singleton: true, eager: true },
          },
        })
      );
    }
    return config;
  },
};
```
- **Remote applications (`dataVizApp`, `reportsApp`) are dynamically loaded** based on URLs defined in `DATAVIZ_URL` and `REPORTS_URL`.
- **Shared dependencies (React, Redux, etc.)** are defined as **singletons** to avoid version mismatches.

## **3. CI/CD Automation Deployment (GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, ArgoCD)**

Micro-frontends require **independent deployment pipelines**. We use **CI/CD automation** with **GitHub Actions** and **Kubernetes + ArgoCD**.

### **GitHub Actions for Continuous Deployment**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18.x
      - run: npm ci && npm run build
      - run: docker build -t myregistry.com/data-viz-app:${{ github.sha }} .
      - run: docker push myregistry.com/data-viz-app:${{ github.sha }}
```

### **Kubernetes Deployment with ArgoCD**
ArgoCD automates **multi-tenant Kubernetes deployments**, ensuring **isolated tenant environments** .

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadadata-viz-app
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: data-viz-app
          image: myregistry.com/data-viz-app:latest
```
ArgoCD will **auto-sync** Kubernetes resources based on **Git commits**, achieving **GitOps-based automated deployment**.

## **4. Security, Authentication, and RBAC Access Control**

We implement:
- **OAuth2.0 / OpenID Connect (OIDC) Authentication** (via Auth0, Okta, or AWS Cognito).
- **JWT-Based Authentication** (short-lived access tokens, refresh tokens).
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with tenant-level permissions.

---

## **5. Performance Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Sentry)**

- **Web Vitals Monitoring** (LCP, FID, CLS) for frontend performance tracking.
- **Prometheus + Grafana** for backend metrics monitoring.
- **ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for centralized logging.
- **Sentry for Frontend Error Tracking**.
